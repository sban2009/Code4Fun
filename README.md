# Personal Coding Playground

This repository contains a collection of coding solutions, algorithm implementations, and problem-solving exercises across various languages and domains. It is organized for learning, experimentation, and interview preparation.

## Structure

- **project-euler/**: Solutions to Project Euler problems in multiple languages (C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Haskell, Rust, Solidity).
- **DSA Problems**: Standalone scripts for DSA problems (C, C++, Python) from platforms or books.
- **Company/Contest Problems**: Solutions to problems from coding interviews and contests (Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, CodeVita, Codility, etc.).

## Languages Used

- Python
- C / C++
- Java
- JavaScript (WIP)
- Haskell (WIP)
- Rust (WIP)
- Solidity (WIP)

## Usage

- Browse the folders and files for problem statements and solutions.
- Each file is self-contained and can be compiled or run independently.
- For Project Euler, see `project-euler/README.md`
